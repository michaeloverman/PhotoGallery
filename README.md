# PhotoGallery
A Big Nerd Ranch Guide project
This project teaches how to create an AsyncTask to run tasks in the background. PhotoGallery is scouring Flickr for photos and their related metadata. By parsing a JSON file returned from Flickr, individual photos can be found. The search bar allows us to look for specific types of pictures, and by using loopers and handlers, photos are downloaded and displayed. This app also implements a background service, to poll Flickr for new pictures that fit the user's search query. An AlarmManager is set up to poll Flickr in the background, even when the users is no longer using the PhotoGallery, and a Notification will inform the user when new pictures are availble. Selecting a photo in PhotoGallery will show the user, in a WebView, that photo's Flickr page.
